v0.4.1
------

This is a minor release with some important fixes. Additionally, PIMS is no
longer a required dependency, which makes installation easier.


API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- PIMS (Python IMage Sequence) is no longer a required dependency (:issue:`492`)


Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Improved performance of adaptive search (:issue:`489`)
- Reduced memory usage during linking (:issue:`489`)


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fix enable_numba on Py3.6 and MS Windows systems (:issue:`486`)


v0.4.0
------

This is a major release that includes new choices for linking and feature-finding algorithms, as well as many
performance increases and clean-ups. It is recommended for all trackpy users, but may require
minor changes to existing code, as detailed below.

API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- locate has a more modular structure that makes it easier to customize feature-finding (:issue:`400`, :issue:`406`)

- The default value of smoothing_size is smaller, and more consistent with
  other implementations of this algorithm. In general, particle
  mass values will be different. The new minmass_v04_change function helps
  update minmass values in existing code (:issue:`401`, :issue:`465`)

- The "minmass" parameter now has a default value of 0 (:issue:`400`)

- The "filter_before" option is no longer supported (:issue:`400`)

- Major refactor of the linking code giving linking a better API (:issue:`416`, :issue:`414`)

- Linking diagnostics are no longer supported (:issue:`414`)

- link_df always creates a copy of the data; it can no longer work in-place (:issue:`414`)


Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Improved performance of feature finding (:issue:`361`)

- Improved performance of linking (:issue:`400`, :issue:`406`)

- New refinement method using least squares optimization (:issue:`407`)

- New linker that combines feature-finding with linking (FindLinker) (:issue:`407`, :issue:`410`, :issue:`411`, :issue:`416`, :issue:`428`)

- Linking in non-Euclidean coordinate systems and curved metrics (:issue:`448`)


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fix compute_drift if dataframes are not sorted (:issue:`409`)

- Fix double counting of non-linking penalty in non-numba linkers (:issue:`430`)

- Fix the N column for emsd (:issue:`434`)
