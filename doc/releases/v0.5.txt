v0.5
----

This is a major release focused on enhancements. Most notably, parallel
processing is now turned on by default for "trackpy.batch" and
"trackpy.locate_brightfield_ring", resulting in a large performance increase
for many users. Another minor speedup changes the way in which particle numbers
are generated, which may cause issues with reproducibility in some existing
workflows (see "API Changes" below).

Note that Python 2 reached end-of-life in 2020, and it is no longer officially
supported by trackpy. Also, trackpy dropped support for older NumPy, Scipy and Pandas.
The current minimum requirements are: ``python>=3.6 numpy>=1.14 scipy>=1.1 pandas>=0.22``.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- "compute_drift()" now accepts list-like "pos_columns" (e.g. tuples). (:issue:`579`)

- "trackpy.locate_brightfield_ring" now defaults to parallel execution with all
  available CPUs, as controlled by the optional "processes" argument (:issue:`602`)

- "refine_brightfield_ring()" now uses the 5th percentile for edge detection
  instead of the minimum, resulting in a more robust tracking for low contrast
  images. (:issue:`602`)


API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- "trackpy.batch" now defaults to parallel execution with all available CPUs
  ("processes='auto'"). For most users this should be a noticeable speedup.
  Revert to the previous behavior with "processes=1". (:issue:`605`)

- During linking, particles are not sorted before assigning new
  trajectories. This greatly speeds up linking under certain conditions.
  The actual coordinates and linked trajectories are not affected by this
  change, but the unique number assigned to a trajectory (in the "particle"
  column) may vary from run to run. The most reproducible way to identify a
  specific particle is still the particle's coordinates at an instant in time.
  To make the numbering stable again, set the "PYTHONHASHSEED" environment
  variable before starting Python.
