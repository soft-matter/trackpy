v0.6.1
------

trackpy v0.6.1 is functionally equivalent to v0.6.0. It is being released
to fix an issue with Zenodo, so that this trackpy release has a citable DOI.

v0.6.0
------

This release adds an efficient way to use custom distance metrics during
linking, and fixes bugs and some inconsistencies in the prediction
capabilities. Some existing code that used prediction may now fail to run until
a (minor) update is made.

This release includes contributions by @magnunor, @freemansw1, @crisp-snakey,
@rbnvrw, @caspervdw, @tacaswell, and @nkeim.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Linking can now use any ``DistanceMetric`` class from sklearn to compute
  distances (#692 by @freemansw1)
- Several documentation fixes by @magnunor and @nkeim

API Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

- When supplying an initial velocity guess to NearestVelocityPredict or
  DriftPredict, you must also supply the pos_columns argument to identify
  the names of the columns in your array. (For example,
  "pos_columns = ['y', 'x']".) Otherwise, creating the predictor will
  raise an exception that explains this change. If you provide pos_columns
  when creating the predictor, you do not have to supply it when subsequently
  using the link_df() or link_df_iter() methods to link your features.

- ``reconnect_traj_patch()`` is now available as ``trackpy.reconnect_traj_patch``
  and is described in the API documentation. (@nkeim, #648)

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- When linking with prediction, the predictor now correctly uses the same
  position columns as the linker, and correctly handles the pos_columns
  argument if specified. (@nkeim, #710)
- The link_df() method of predictor objects now works correctly. This is
  reflected in the updated prediction tutorial. (@nkeim, #710)

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- trackpy is now being tested in conda environments with Python 3.10.
- trackpy is no longer tested with Python 3.6.
- trackpy now requires the ``looseversion`` package to work with newer scipy
  (@crisp-snakey, #706)
- Much work on testing and packaging infrastructure by @tacaswell and @caspervdw
